## General info

I took the time to write this little guide cause people always tried to scare me about how technical and/or hard was to install Arch Linux. I followed their ever present advice to "read the Wiki". And I found not funny step-by-step as they had implied. Fortunately, I survive that installation and I can say it was just a Lake Ness legend. I hope the few lines in this Markdown file make you take that courage as well.

## Technologies

- Markdown
- VSCode
- Eyes fixed on Preview Tab

## Setup

- Download the ISO file from [Arch Linux Download page] using the link is best for you;
- Make a LiveUSB with it using [Arch's instructions] for that;
- When the Arch menu appears, select `Boot Arch Linux` and press Enter to enter the installation environment;
- Start using this guide.

## Features

- Avoid wasting your time reading dozens of pages from [Installation Guide] just to get it started;
- You can use your custom information (shown as `YOUR-....` portion of the command) or just copy-and-paste what you see;
- Installation done just in time to install your favorite DE (desktop environment).

### To-do list

- More steps for the reader to choose;
- Translation to Brazilian Portuguese (my native language);
- Turn the guide into a full script.

## Status

Project is: **_in progress_**

## Notes

This is kind of a "quickstart" guide for Arch Linux installation. This guide by no means intends to substitute the official [Arch Installation Guide]. If you want to clarify some ideas left ambiguous in this guide, please contact me. Or if you're in a hurry, consult the official guide.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by my curiosity in install a new OS. Certainly the order part of inspiration were the avid members of [CodeWalkers' project]. Also, in the 0.0.8 version of this guide, I was heavily inspired by [ritaly's README-cheatsheet] while I was searching for a better, more informative README. Thanks y'all!
